				The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
				<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

        <p>I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. It walked on my pillow! I've made a huge tiny mistake. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is.They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw.
